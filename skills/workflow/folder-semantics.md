# Folder semantics

Reference for every `flightdeck/` subdirectory: what it holds, naming convention, lifecycle, and links to related folders.

## Minimal vs full setup

Not every project needs every folder. Start with just `cockpit.md`. Add folders **when the need appears**, not preemptively.

| Setup | What exists |
| --- | --- |
| **Minimal** | `flightdeck/cockpit.md` only |
| **+ design** | add `specs/` when first design doc is worth writing |
| **+ planning** | add `plans/` when first implementation plan is needed |
| **+ knowledge** | add `incidents/` when first lesson is worth keeping |
| **+ procedures** | add `checklists/` when a multi-step process is run a second time |
| **Full** | all folders, each with its `INDEX.md`, + `cockpit.md` (+ optional `rules.md`) |

Premature folder creation is an anti-pattern. Empty directories signal "this should be filled" and create pressure to write low-signal content.

## Routing model

**Flightdeck is graph-routed, not filesystem-routed.** A file is "active" only if it is reachable from some entry — `cockpit.md`, `INDEX.md`, or `rules.md`. **A file not reachable from any entry effectively does not exist** (no session will ever read it). `walkaround` audits reachability.

Reachability edges are markdown links from an entry. Custom folders / root files are allowed — flightdeck favors extensible conventions over a locked taxonomy — **but they must be reachable from an entry**, or `walkaround` flags them as orphans.

## Which folder? (decision table)

Classify by lifecycle — the folder is the kind, so files carry no type field:

| What you have | Goes in |
| --- | --- |
| Uncommitted idea (not yet ready to act on) | `sketches/` |
| Design to review or implement | `specs/` |
| Implementation plan (optionally `implements:` a spec) | `plans/` |
| Bug + root cause worth not repeating | `incidents/` |
| Repeated procedure (second run = pattern) | `checklists/` |
| Imported external material (competitor code, RFCs, articles) | `charts/` |
| External review / AI critique + disposition | `debriefs/` |

The common mistake is keeping an evergreen reference in `specs/` or `plans/`. A spec/plan is a *design or plan you intend to build and then archive*; an evergreen standard you consult repeatedly belongs in `checklists/`. (`checklists/` = authored operational reference; `charts/` = imported external material — keep that split clear.)

```

## Entry files

### `cockpit.md` — the single must-read

**The only required file.** Read first, updated last. Hard ceiling: **80 lines**.

The 80-line ceiling is cognitive-load engineering for the human + AI reading cockpit at every session start — treat it as a load-bearing constraint, not a style preference.

Contains:
- `Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD by <who> (<one-line>)`
- `Active focus: <current main thread>`
- `## Next session` — 1–5 concrete items.
- `## Hanging tasks` — open items blocking a clean landing (hand-maintained; decoupled from INDEX auto-summaries).

`cockpit.md` is the pure focus layer: "what am I working on now". Status visibility is delegated to INDEX — look at the relevant folder's INDEX (or the root INDEX) to see the full picture.

### `rules.md` — optional project config

Read first by every entry skill. Carries a closed set of toggles (`git`, `emit_agents_md`, `disabled_folders`, `disabled_gates`) plus free-prose house rules. Absent = defaults (git on, emit on, all folders active). Full schema: [templates.md § rules.md](templates.md#rulesmd).

### `INDEX.md` — root index

The root `flightdeck/INDEX.md` is a subfolder directory plus global status summary, generated from each subfolder's `INDEX.md`. Example:

```markdown
# flightdeck — INDEX

<!-- AUTO:root -->
- specs/ — 3 (2 active, 1 done)
- plans/ — 2 (1 active, 1 blocked)
- incidents/ — 1 active
- checklists/ — 1 active
- charts/ — 2 imported
- debriefs/ — 1 active
- sketches/ — 4
<!-- /AUTO -->
```

Note: `charts/` rows show a file/project count and "imported" rather than a status count, because imported external files do not carry uniform flightdeck frontmatter.

The root INDEX is a **downgradeable component** — if the project finds per-folder INDEXes sufficient and the root INDEX underused, it may be removed without affecting the model.

### `landed/HISTORY.md` — landing log

Lives under `landed/`, so it is **outside the routing graph** (never read at session start). An **add-only** log (never edit or delete past entries), one line per landing, **newest first**.

**Required when `rules.md` sets `git: false`** (no commit log to lean on); optional otherwise.

## INDEX.md (per-folder)

Every artifact folder — including `sketches/` — has its own `INDEX.md`. This is the derived index for that folder: one row per file showing file, status, and a one-line summary. `incidents/`, `checklists/`, `charts/` rows add `when_to_read` / `applies_to`; `debriefs/` rows instead show the reviewed spec/topic + date (no trigger routing).

Structure:

```markdown
# specs/ — INDEX

<!-- AUTO:specs -->
- [2026-06-01-auth-redesign.md](2026-06-01-auth-redesign.md) — active — redesign the auth layer for OAuth2
- [2026-05-10-billing.md](2026-05-10-billing.md) — done — billing module spec
<!-- /AUTO -->

<!-- Optional hand area: grouping notes, multi-file topic labeling, etc. AI does not touch this. -->
```

Rules:
- **Minimum columns**: `[filename](filename) — status — one-line summary`. `incidents/`, `checklists/`, `charts/` rows add `when_to_read` / `applies_to`; `debriefs/` rows instead show the reviewed spec/topic + date (no trigger routing). The `implements:` field does NOT appear in the INDEX (kept lightweight; reverse-lookup by scanning `plans/INDEX.md`).
- **`<!-- AUTO -->` region is machine-maintained**: the AI regenerates this region from each file's frontmatter. Content outside this region is a hand area — the AI never modifies it. This rule is written into `rules.md` / the skill to prevent different sessions from appending rather than regenerating.
- **Regeneration scope**: `landing` regenerates only the INDEX of folders that had file changes this session (new, modified, moved, landed, or status-changed files). Other folders' INDEXes are left untouched. `walkaround` does a full INDEX↔frontmatter consistency check across all folders.
- **Commands read INDEX first**: all commands follow "read INDEX first, drill into individual files only on demand" — this is the primary token saving (cost scales with folder count, not file count). `preflight` reads folder INDEXes (or the root INDEX) to get `when_to_read`/`applies_to` + status; it only reads a full file when it is about to apply it. `walkaround` reads INDEXes for the initial scan, drilling down only to verify suspects.

## Folder details

### `sketches/` — uncommitted ideas

Unstarted ideas waiting for a trigger. `status: active` or `scrapped`. **The folder is the kind — files carry no type field; no `implements:`.**

Naming: `<topic>.md` (no date prefix — ideas are timeless until acted on).

**Frontmatter**:
```yaml
---
status: active    # active / scrapped
---
```

**Promote** a sketch to a spec when it becomes actionable: move `sketches/foo.md → specs/foo.md` and set `status: pending`. The sketch leaves `sketches/` on promotion.

**Scrap** a sketch (`status: scrapped`) when the idea is abandoned. A scrapped sketch stays in `sketches/` (marked `status: scrapped`); it is **never archived to `landed/`**. Delete by hand at will — `walkaround` does not flag deletions of scrapped sketches.

Transient session scratch belongs at project-root `tmp/` (gitignored), not here.

### `specs/` — designs

Committed design documents to review or implement. A spec captures the *what* and *why* of a change; it is the output of the brainstorming / design stage.

Naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` (date helps order by recency; specs are time-bound designs).

**Frontmatter**:
```yaml
---
status: pending    # pending / active / awaiting-review / blocked / done / scrapped
---
```

The folder is the kind — files carry no type field. No `implements:` (that goes on the plan side).

Lifecycle: when a spec is done and all its plans are complete, `land` it — move to `landed/specs/foo.md`. The spec leaves the active routing set but its history is preserved.

### `plans/` — implementation plans

Task-level breakdowns of how to execute a spec (or a standalone piece of work). Plans carry the optional `implements:` back-reference to the spec they execute.

Naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`.

**Frontmatter**:
```yaml
---
status: active           # pending / active / awaiting-review / blocked / done / scrapped
implements: specs/<x>.md  # optional; relative to flightdeck root; walkaround warns "orphan plan" if absent
---
```

`implements:` is a single unidirectional reference. To see which plans implement a given spec, read `plans/INDEX.md` — do NOT add a reverse `implemented_by:` field to the spec.

A plan without `implements:` is valid but `walkaround` surfaces an INFO ("orphan plan — no spec linked").

### `incidents/` — post-incident records

Mistakes worth not repeating. Format strictly enforces useful root cause (template in [templates.md](templates.md#incident-report-body)).

Naming: `<topic>.md` (no date prefix — incident reports are reference, not log).

Recurrence rule: same incident happens again → **append `## [Case N]`** to existing file. Do not create a new file. Repeated recurrence (≥3 times or single severe case) → promote one-liner to your project agent rules.

**Frontmatter**:
```yaml
---
status: active            # active / obsolete / superseded
when_to_read: <one-line trigger condition>
applies_to: [<tag>, ...]
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
# when status: superseded — add: superseded_by: <path>
---
```

`when_to_read` and `applies_to` are required. An incident without `when_to_read` is invisible to skill routing. `last_updated` must be bumped on each Case append or status flip.

### `checklists/` — procedures

Authored **operational reference**: reusable checklists, conventions, and reference standards worth consulting more than once.

Naming: `<topic>.md` (no date prefix — checklists are stable resources).

Promotion rule: a process becomes a checklist the **second** time you run it. First time = ad-hoc. Second time = pattern.

**Frontmatter**:
```yaml
---
status: active            # active / obsolete / superseded
when_to_read: <one-line trigger condition>
applies_to: [<tag>, ...]
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
# when status: superseded — add: superseded_by: <path>
# optional: skip_when: <one-line "when NOT to read this">
---
```

`status: superseded` requires `superseded_by: <path>`. `status: obsolete` means the external constraint no longer exists; `status: superseded` means a newer checklist replaces this one. Both may stay in place indefinitely — no automatic "to-land" reminder.

### `charts/` — external material

External docs, competitor source code, RFCs, blog posts, etc. — a single place for "where do I find that thing".

Naming: `<source>-<topic>.md` (e.g. `boltframe-shape-layer.md`, `rfc-6749.md`).

**Frontmatter** (for single-file chart entries):
```yaml
---
status: active            # active / obsolete / superseded
when_to_read: <one-line trigger>
applies_to: [<tag>, ...]
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
# when status: superseded — add: superseded_by: <path>
---
```

**Imported external project tree**: `charts/` is the only folder where a subdirectory is permitted. When importing an entire external project (competitor code, an RFC suite, a large article series), place it at `charts/<project>/` and add a `charts/<project>/INDEX.md` as a human-readable guide to the project's contents. The root `charts/INDEX.md` row for that project shows project count + "imported" rather than a status count (imported files do not carry uniform flightdeck frontmatter).

### `debriefs/` — external review feedback

Raw feedback from reviewers (other AIs, colleagues) + your **disposition** (adopt / reject / defer).

Naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-<spec-or-topic>-<reviewer>.md`.

**Frontmatter**:
```yaml
---
status: active            # active / obsolete / superseded
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

Retrieved by the spec/topic reviewed + date, not by a trigger — so no `when_to_read`/`applies_to`.

Disposition rule: no debrief can exist in `debriefs/` without a disposition section. If disposition is incomplete, add a hanging task to `cockpit.md` ("finish disposition of `<file>`") and do not close the session.

### `landed/` — archive umbrella

Top-level archive for completed or retired work. `landed/` **mirrors any source folder on demand** — create the matching subdirectory the first time you archive something of that kind.

- `landed/specs/` — specs archived after the work is done.
- `landed/plans/` — plans archived after execution.
- `landed/incidents/`, `landed/checklists/`, `landed/charts/`, `landed/debriefs/` — obsolete-but-historical reference moved out of the active set.
- `landed/HISTORY.md` — append-only landing log.

Archiving vs `status: obsolete/superseded`: flip `status` to keep a dead file in place (still reachable, marked dead); **move to `landed/`** to remove it from the active routing set while preserving history. Archived files lose to current state in [authority order](SKILL.md#authority-order-when-sources-disagree). Routing already excludes everything under `landed/`.

Archived files are **exempt from status and INDEX audits** — `walkaround` does not check `landed/`.

## Multi-file topics — no subfolders

When one topic needs several files (a multi-chapter reference, a large spec), keep **all files in the same folder**. Group them in that folder's `INDEX.md` hand area (outside the `<!-- AUTO -->` region) with a label like `### Auth redesign (3 files)`.

**Do NOT create subfolders inside `specs/`, `plans/`, `incidents/`, `checklists/`, or `debriefs/`.** Subfolders reintroduce the "what kind is the subfolder" question and break the flat routing model.

The sole exception is `charts/`: an imported external project may carry its own directory tree — see the `charts/` section above.

## README → INDEX

Within flightdeck conventions, always use `INDEX.md` — never `README.md`. `INDEX.md` precisely communicates "directory navigation" (as opposed to "project introduction").

The repository-root `README.md` (the GitHub project intro) is a standard project file and is **not affected** by this rule.

## Naming convention table

| Folder | Filename pattern | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sketches/` | `<topic>.md` | Ideas are timeless until acted on |
| `specs/` | `YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` | Date helps order by recency; specs are time-bound designs |
| `plans/` | `YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` | Date helps order by recency; plans are time-bound |
| `incidents/` | `<topic>.md` | Stable reference — date noise hurts findability |
| `checklists/` | `<topic>.md` | Stable resource — date noise hurts |
| `charts/` | `<source>-<topic>.md` | External source is the key identifier |
| `debriefs/` | `YYYY-MM-DD-<spec>-<reviewer>.md` | Date + reviewer identify uniqueness |

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Empty subdirs created to "establish the convention" | Pressure to fill → low-signal writes | Minimal setup; add folders on demand |
| Same fact duplicated across folders | Drift → trust collapses | One authoritative source; others link |
| Incident report files named `2026-05-23-bug.md` | Date noise; impossible to find by topic | Use `<topic>.md` |
| `tmp/` placed inside `flightdeck/` | Junk gets committed | `tmp/` lives at project root, gitignored |
| Subfolders inside `specs/` / `plans/` / `incidents/` / `checklists/` / `debriefs/` | Breaks flat routing; "what kind is the subfolder?" | Keep all files in the folder; group in INDEX hand area |
| Using `README.md` inside flightdeck conventions | Bundle README approach retired | Use `INDEX.md` (repo-root `README.md` is unaffected) |
| Plan with no `implements:` and no explanation | Orphan plan is invisible to spec→plan tracing | Add `implements:` or note "standalone" in the plan body |
| Checklist or incident without `when_to_read` | Invisible to skill routing | Add `when_to_read` frontmatter |
